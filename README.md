# Structure from Motion (SFM) Code

## Overview
This repository contains code for implementing Structure from Motion (SFM), a computer vision technique used for reconstructing three-dimensional scenes from a set of images. SFM is commonly used in applications such as robotics, augmented reality, and photogrammetry.

## Features
- **Feature Extraction:** Utilizes feature detection algorithms (e.g., SIFT, SURF, ORB) to extract key points from images.
- **Feature Matching:** Matches corresponding features across multiple images to establish correspondences.
- **Triangulation:** Computes the three-dimensional position of points by triangulating corresponding points in multiple images.
- **Bundle Adjustment:** Optimizes the camera parameters and 3D point positions to minimize reprojection errors across all images.
- **Visualization:** Provides tools for visualizing the reconstructed 3D scene and camera poses.

## Usage
1. **Installation:** Clone the repository and install any dependencies specified in the `requirements.txt` file.
2. **Data Preparation:** Prepare your input images and ensure they are correctly formatted for input into the SFM pipeline.
3. **Run SFM:** Execute the main script or Jupyter notebook to run the SFM pipeline on your input images.
4. **Visualization:** Use the provided visualization tools to view the reconstructed 3D scene and camera poses.

## Examples
Include examples of usage here, along with screenshots or visualizations of the reconstructed scenes.

## Packages Used
- numpy: Required for numerical computations and array operations.
- scipy: Utilized for optimization and mathematical operations.
- OpenCV: Used for image processing tasks such as feature detection, matching, and camera calibration.
- matplotlib: Utilized for visualization of images, plots, and 3D scenes.
